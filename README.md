# R Projects Development Template

This repo provides a starting template for a containerized development environment for my R projects in data science and Shiny application development, tailored to both the RStudio IDE as well as Visual Studio Code. For a more detailed description, please see the [`.devcontainer/README.md`](.devcontainer/README.md)),

**HEADS UP**: The latest version of the development files is a fairly substantial overhaul of the setup in the screencast below. I will record another video with the updates soon!

ðŸŽ¥ Check out this previous [Shiny Developer Series livestream](https://youtu.be/4wRiPG9LM3o) for a hands-on walkthrough of this setup!
